Analysis of mental health awareness tweets during Mental Health Awareness Month using R

# Project Overview

May is mental health month and this often means an increase in postings about mental health issues on social media sites. These postings can provide insight into some of the stigma surrounding mental health as well as the ways mental health advocates are trying to combat that stigma. In this project, tweets from the hashtags:

- #mentalhealthawareness
- #depression
- #anxiety
- #ptsd
- #suicide

were collected and analyzed using R in order to better understand how mental health issues are communicated on Twitter.
